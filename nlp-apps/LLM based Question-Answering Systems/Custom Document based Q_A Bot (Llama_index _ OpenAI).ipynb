She is tasked with helping to inject the victims with a new substance, but she is overwhelmed by the moral implications of her actions and runs away. She finds solace in a brook and falls asleep, only to be awoken by a display of auroral discharge in the sky. She realizes that the experiment has begun and is filled with awe and fear at the power of her people. She remembers a man saying that the charge on Station One is so great that it would arc a million miles or more. She then sees the auroral display and realizes that the Terrans have arrived with the goods. She sets off to Dorana, determined to get back to Indilee, and is ultimately revealed to be the one who brought the Terrans.\n","\n","\n","\n","What do you want to ask the bot?   \n","stop\n","\n","Bot says: \n","\n","\n","\n","Sandra is feeling a mixture of awe, fear, admiration, and pride. She is in awe of the power of humans to tamper with the universe, and fearful of the consequences of their actions. At the same time, she is admiring of the ability of her own people to discuss both mundane and complex topics with the same words and inflections.
